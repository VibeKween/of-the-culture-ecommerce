# Cart Testing Environment - SESSION #010

**SAFETY FIRST**: This isolated testing environment prevents any breakage to production pages

## Purpose
Test shopping cart functionality completely in isolation before any integration with the production site.

## Testing Protocol
1. All cart functionality must work perfectly in this environment first
2. Mobile responsiveness must be validated here
3. LocalStorage operations must be tested thoroughly
4. No integration with production pages until 100% validation complete

## Safety Rollback
- **Working Commit**: bd8a300 (lazy loading system)  
- **Emergency Rollback**: `git reset --hard bd8a300`
- **Development Branch**: cart-development-safe (GitHub backup created)
