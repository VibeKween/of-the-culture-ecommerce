**üéØ Text Message-Style Framing:**
- **Generous White Space**: 24px padding + scaling creates breathing room around all models
- **No Edge Cropping**: Complete composition visible including extreme edges
- **Visual Balance**: Matches reference text message framing exactly
- **Clean Implementation**: position: relative + overflow: visible for proper transform behavior

### CSS Architecture Improvements
**Mobile-Specific Enhancements:**
```css
.hero-image-container {
  aspect-ratio: 16/10; /* Match image dimensions exactly */
  padding: 24px; /* White frame padding */
  background-color: #ffffff; /* Text message-style white frame */
  overflow: visible; /* Allow scaled image to show properly */
}

.hero-image-container img {
  position: relative; /* Remove absolute positioning conflict */
  transform: scale(0.85); /* Perfect scaling for white frame effect */
  object-fit: contain; /* Show full composition without cropping */
}
```

## Session 8 - CMS Development Attempt & Recovery  
**Date**: September 1, 2025  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Complete - System Restored After Failed CMS Integration

### Session Overview
Attempted to build a comprehensive content management system for scalable copy updates, but encountered critical functionality failure during testing phase. Successfully restored to working state and developed prevention plan for future CMS development.

### CMS Architecture Built
**Complete markdown-based content management system featuring:**
- Text-based content files with bracketed sections `[SECTION_NAME]`
- JavaScript content loader with validation and SEO optimization
- Template system for copywriters with brand voice integration
- Character limit enforcement (60 for titles, 155 for descriptions)
- Image metadata management system

### Critical Failure Point
**What Happened**: Testing CMS integration on shop page completely broke the CSS Grid layout
- Product grid disappeared entirely
- Only product names appeared as underlined blue text
- All product cards, images, and hover effects vanished
- Issue persisted across browsers and incognito mode

**Root Cause**: CMS JavaScript interfered with existing CSS grid system during DOM manipulation

### Emergency Recovery Process
- **git reset --hard 8b51675** to restore working commit ("REFINE: Target image only for hover lift effect")
- Complete removal of all CMS files and data attributes
- Verification that local environment matches live GitHub Pages exactly
- All 8 pages confirmed working properly (homepage, lookbook, shop, 5 product pages)

### Key Lessons Learned
1. **Testing Protocol**: Never test new systems directly on production-ready pages
2. **Integration Approach**: CMS should be completely separate from existing systems
3. **Risk Assessment**: Content management changes can have unexpected layout consequences
4. **Recovery Strategy**: Proper version control enables fast recovery from failed experiments

### Prevention Plan for Next CMS Session
**Phase 1**: Isolated development environment with separate testing branch
**Phase 2**: Non-invasive architecture (build-time processing vs runtime loading)
**Phase 3**: Progressive enhancement with comprehensive testing checklist
**Phase 4**: Alternative approaches (markdown + build process, git-based workflow)

### Status
- ‚úÖ Local environment fully restored to working state
- ‚úÖ All functionality verified across 8 pages
- ‚úÖ Live GitHub Pages site remains unaffected
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive prevention plan developed
- üìã Ready for safer, methodical CMS development approach

## Session 7 - Mobile Click Shadows Resolution  
**Date**: August 31, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Mobile Touch Interaction Issues Resolved

### Critical Issue Addressed
**Mobile Click Shadows**: Users experienced unwanted gray shadow boxes when tapping product cards on shop page - not present before recent changes.

### Root Cause Analysis
**Primary Culprit**: Global link hover effects in `main.css` were triggering on mobile touch events
- `transform: translateY(-1px)` and `opacity: 0.8` effects activated on mobile taps
- No media query protection for desktop-only hover interactions  
- Mobile browsers can activate `:hover` pseudo-classes before navigation

### QA Investigation Process
- Systematic testing identified CSS specificity conflicts
- Multiple attempted fixes (exclusions, !important overrides) were insufficient
- Required comprehensive mobile touch protection at global CSS level

### Technical Solution Implemented

**Main.css Changes:**
```css
/* Desktop-only hover effects */
@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  a:not(.directory-link):not(.nav-link):not(.product-card):hover {
    opacity: 0.8;
    transform: translateY(-1px);
  }
}

/* Mobile touch protection */
@media (hover: none) and (pointer: coarse) {
  .product-card,
  .product-card:hover,
  .product-card:active,
  .product-card:focus {
    opacity: 1 !important;
    transform: none !important;
    box-shadow: none !important;
    outline: none !important;
    transition: none !important;
  }
}
```

**Shop.css Cleanup:**
- Removed redundant override rules that were causing CSS bloat
- Simplified interaction handling by centralizing in main.css

### Additional Enhancement
**Mobile Image Aspect Ratio**: Increased mobile product image boxes from 140% to 160% for better visual prominence and user engagement.

### Final Result
- **Mobile**: Zero visual effects on tap - clean, immediate navigation
- **Desktop**: Elegant hover animations preserved (translateY, opacity, box-shadow)  
- **Cross-platform**: Future-proof media queries for different interaction methods

**Status**: 100% Issue Resolution ‚úÖ

### Final Resolution & Performance Improvement
**SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION**: Clean, modern mobile tap elimination solution using industry-standard CSS properties:
- `webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent` 
- `tap-highlight-color: transparent`
- `touch-action: manipulation`

**Results Confirmed:**
- ‚úÖ Mobile shadow boxes completely eliminated
- ‚úÖ Navigation speed improved - faster product card navigation
- ‚úÖ Zero technical debt - future-proof implementation
- ‚úÖ Universal browser compatibility
- ‚úÖ No conflicts with existing code

**User Feedback**: "the last edit we made re. mobile clicking and shadow box worked! the page also seems to quickly navigate to the product card, faster than it did before"

## Session 6 - Mobile UX Refinements
**Date**: August 31, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Mobile Select Text Sizing Fixed

### Issues Addressed
- **Mobile Select Text Overflow**: "Select" text was overflowing dropdown boxes on all product pages except NAKAMOTO
- **Scroll-Triggered Cart Reliability**: Mobile cart wasn't appearing consistently due to restrictive trigger logic

### Root Cause Analysis
NAKAMOTO page worked correctly because it only has "One Size" option, while other pages have multiple size options (XS, S, M, L, XL) requiring more width for proper "Select" text display in mobile layout.

### Solutions Implemented
**Mobile Select Text Sizing:**
- Reduced font-size: `0.85rem ‚Üí 0.75rem` for better fit in constrained mobile dropdowns
- Adjusted padding: `12px 10px ‚Üí 10px 8px` for tighter, more efficient layout
- Optimized dropdown arrow size (16px ‚Üí 14px) and repositioned for smaller padding
- Added `line-height: 1.2` for improved vertical text alignment

**Mobile Layout Optimization:**
- Size selection: `flex: 1 ‚Üí flex: 1.2` (20% more width to accommodate multi-size options)
- Quantity selection: `flex: 1 ‚Üí flex: 0.8` (20% less width since it only displays single digits)
- Layout now scales automatically for future size additions (XXL, XXXL, custom sizes)

**Scroll-Triggered Cart Improvements:**
- Enhanced IntersectionObserver trigger logic: now triggers when user scrolls past 50% of main image
- Added 3-second fallback timer to ensure cart appears even if scroll detection fails
- Improved initialization with 100ms DOM rendering delay and window resize handler
- Added console logging for debugging cart trigger behavior

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: `/pages/product/product.css`, `/shared/js/product-modal.js`
- **Scope**: All product pages now have consistent, properly-sized mobile select elements
- **Future-Proof**: System accommodates any size option additions without further modifications
- **Backward Compatible**: Desktop layout and functionality unchanged

### Testing Completed
- ‚úÖ Mobile select text sizing verified across all product pages
- ‚úÖ Scroll-triggered mobile cart functionality improved with fallback protection
- ‚úÖ Layout maintains responsive flexibility for future size option expansions

### Technical Debt Backlog Added
- **Global CSS Architecture Refactoring**: Evolve from patchwork overrides to systematic context-aware select styling
- **CSS Evolution Enhancement**: Replace multiple `!important` declarations with cohesive mobile/desktop responsive system
