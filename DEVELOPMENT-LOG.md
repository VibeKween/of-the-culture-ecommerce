# Development Log - OF THE CULTURE Ecommerce

## Session 1 - Foundation Setup
**Date**: August 22, 2025

### Objectives
- Create project structure for OF THE CULTURE ecommerce site
- Implement homepage based on 02-LANDING-PAGE foundation
- Add grosgrain label brand element
- Establish documentation and folder structure

### Completed Work

**Project Structure Created**:
- `03-ECOMMERCE-OF-THE-CULTURE/` main directory
- Page-specific folders: `homepage/`, `lookbook/`, `shop/`, `product/`, `cart/`, `checkout/`
- Shared resources: `shared/css/`, `images/`, `docs/`
- Documentation: `README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT-LOG.md`

**Homepage Implementation**:
- Copied foundation from 02-LANDING-PAGE
- Removed email contact section
- Added grosgrain label element with brand ethos text
- Maintained SVG wordmark system
- Preserved cultural-header gold accent styling

**Grosgrain Label Features**:
- Lekton font family for clothing label aesthetic
- Repeating linear gradient background (grosgrain texture)
- Text overlay with gradient clip for texture effect
- Mobile-responsive sizing and padding
- Brand ethos: "Drawing inspiration from optimism & ingenuity found within decentralization..."

### Technical Decisions

**Folder Structure Logic**:
- **Page-specific folders**: Allow isolated development and iteration
- **Shared resources**: Maintain consistency across pages
- **Relative paths**: Enable modular deployment options

**Design System Preservation**:
- Maintained 02-LANDING-PAGE color system
- Kept JetBrains Mono typography hierarchy
- Preserved 600px max-width, centered layout
- Mobile-first responsive approach (768px breakpoint)

### Next Session Planning

**Priority Items**:
1. Add navigation links to homepage (subtle integration)
2. Create lookbook page with product imagery
3. Develop product catalog structure
4. Plan shopping cart functionality

**Architecture Considerations**:
- Navigation approach: Inline content links vs. discrete menu
- Product data structure: Static vs. dynamic content
- Cart state management: Local storage vs. session-based
- Checkout integration: Payment processor selection

### Files Created
- `/pages/homepage/index.html` - Homepage with grosgrain label
- `/shared/css/main.css` - Base styling system + grosgrain styles
- `/README.md` - Project documentation
- `/DEVELOPMENT-LOG.md` - This development log
- `/images/wordmark_2.svg` - Copied from 02-LANDING-PAGE

### Notes
- Grosgrain label serves as signature brand element (will appear on physical garments)
- Page structure ready for commerce functionality integration
- Documentation follows TUKU-GROUP workspace standards
