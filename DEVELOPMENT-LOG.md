## Session 2 - Tech Stack & Architecture Planning
**Date**: August 22, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Objectives
- Finalize technology stack decisions (pure HTML/CSS vs build tools)
- Plan global site architecture and component system
- Evaluate commerce backend options (Shopify integration)
- Document web3 integration strategy for future phases
- Design API extensibility framework for unlimited third-party integrations

### Completed Work

**Technology Stack Decisions**:
- ✅ **Frontend**: Continue pure HTML/CSS approach (no build tools required)
- ✅ **Backend**: Shopify Basic ($39/month) for professional commerce infrastructure
- ✅ **Payments**: Multi-phase strategy (Traditional → Web3 MFT + stablecoin integration)
- ✅ **Architecture**: Component-based CSS system with API-ready patterns

**Web3 & Crypto Integration Planning**:
- ✅ **Wallet Authentication**: Multi-chain support (MetaMask, Phantom, WalletConnect)
- ✅ **Stablecoin Payments**: Ethereum (USDC, USDT, DAI) + Solana (USDC, USDT)
- ✅ **MFT Integration**: Custom Meta Fungible Token system with physical+digital bundles
- ✅ **Implementation Strategy**: Phased approach (traditional commerce first, web3 when ready)

**API Extensibility Framework**:
- ✅ **Universal API Support**: Architecture supports REST, GraphQL, WebSocket integrations
- ✅ **Future Integrations**: Shopify Admin, email marketing, analytics, social media, AI services
- ✅ **Component Architecture**: Build API-ready UI components now, activate services later
- ✅ **Zero Rebuild Strategy**: Frontend architecture designed to scale without structural changes

**Strategic Documentation Created**:
- `docs/building-in-public/technical-decisions/SESSION-002-TECH-STACK-ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/building-in-public/technical-decisions/WEB3-INFRASTRUCTURE-PLANNING.md`
- `docs/building-in-public/technical-decisions/API-EXTENSIBILITY-FRAMEWORK.md`
- Updated `docs/features/FEATURE-ROADMAP.md` with web3 phases (7-11)
- Updated `docs/DEVELOPMENT-NOTES.md` with backend and API planning

### Key Decisions Made
- **Pure HTML/CSS approach maintained** - Perfect for web3 and API extensibility
- **Shopify Basic selected** - Professional commerce with Apple Pay, future ecosystem access
- **Web3-ready architecture** - Build traditional commerce first, designed for seamless web3 upgrade
- **API extensibility confirmed** - Unlimited third-party integration capability without rebuilds
