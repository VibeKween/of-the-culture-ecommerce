## Session 7 - Mobile Click Shadows Resolution  
**Date**: August 31, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Mobile Touch Interaction Issues Resolved

### Critical Issue Addressed
**Mobile Click Shadows**: Users experienced unwanted gray shadow boxes when tapping product cards on shop page - not present before recent changes.

### Root Cause Analysis
**Primary Culprit**: Global link hover effects in `main.css` were triggering on mobile touch events
- `transform: translateY(-1px)` and `opacity: 0.8` effects activated on mobile taps
- No media query protection for desktop-only hover interactions  
- Mobile browsers can activate `:hover` pseudo-classes before navigation

### QA Investigation Process
- Systematic testing identified CSS specificity conflicts
- Multiple attempted fixes (exclusions, !important overrides) were insufficient
- Required comprehensive mobile touch protection at global CSS level

### Technical Solution Implemented

**Main.css Changes:**
```css
/* Desktop-only hover effects */
@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  a:not(.directory-link):not(.nav-link):not(.product-card):hover {
    opacity: 0.8;
    transform: translateY(-1px);
  }
}

/* Mobile touch protection */
@media (hover: none) and (pointer: coarse) {
  .product-card,
  .product-card:hover,
  .product-card:active,
  .product-card:focus {
    opacity: 1 !important;
    transform: none !important;
    box-shadow: none !important;
    outline: none !important;
    transition: none !important;
  }
}
```

**Shop.css Cleanup:**
- Removed redundant override rules that were causing CSS bloat
- Simplified interaction handling by centralizing in main.css

### Additional Enhancement
**Mobile Image Aspect Ratio**: Increased mobile product image boxes from 140% to 160% for better visual prominence and user engagement.

### Final Result
- **Mobile**: Zero visual effects on tap - clean, immediate navigation
- **Desktop**: Elegant hover animations preserved (translateY, opacity, box-shadow)  
- **Cross-platform**: Future-proof media queries for different interaction methods

**Status**: 100% Issue Resolution ✅

## Session 6 - Mobile UX Refinements
**Date**: August 31, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Mobile Select Text Sizing Fixed

### Issues Addressed
- **Mobile Select Text Overflow**: "Select" text was overflowing dropdown boxes on all product pages except NAKAMOTO
- **Scroll-Triggered Cart Reliability**: Mobile cart wasn't appearing consistently due to restrictive trigger logic

### Root Cause Analysis
NAKAMOTO page worked correctly because it only has "One Size" option, while other pages have multiple size options (XS, S, M, L, XL) requiring more width for proper "Select" text display in mobile layout.

### Solutions Implemented
**Mobile Select Text Sizing:**
- Reduced font-size: `0.85rem → 0.75rem` for better fit in constrained mobile dropdowns
- Adjusted padding: `12px 10px → 10px 8px` for tighter, more efficient layout
- Optimized dropdown arrow size (16px → 14px) and repositioned for smaller padding
- Added `line-height: 1.2` for improved vertical text alignment

**Mobile Layout Optimization:**
- Size selection: `flex: 1 → flex: 1.2` (20% more width to accommodate multi-size options)
- Quantity selection: `flex: 1 → flex: 0.8` (20% less width since it only displays single digits)
- Layout now scales automatically for future size additions (XXL, XXXL, custom sizes)

**Scroll-Triggered Cart Improvements:**
- Enhanced IntersectionObserver trigger logic: now triggers when user scrolls past 50% of main image
- Added 3-second fallback timer to ensure cart appears even if scroll detection fails
- Improved initialization with 100ms DOM rendering delay and window resize handler
- Added console logging for debugging cart trigger behavior

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: `/pages/product/product.css`, `/shared/js/product-modal.js`
- **Scope**: All product pages now have consistent, properly-sized mobile select elements
- **Future-Proof**: System accommodates any size option additions without further modifications
- **Backward Compatible**: Desktop layout and functionality unchanged

### Testing Completed
- ✅ Mobile select text sizing verified across all product pages
- ✅ Scroll-triggered mobile cart functionality improved with fallback protection
- ✅ Layout maintains responsive flexibility for future size option expansions

### Technical Debt Backlog Added
- **Global CSS Architecture Refactoring**: Evolve from patchwork overrides to systematic context-aware select styling
- **CSS Evolution Enhancement**: Replace multiple `!important` declarations with cohesive mobile/desktop responsive system
