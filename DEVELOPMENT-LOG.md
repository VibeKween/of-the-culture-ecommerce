**Date**: August 22, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Objectives

- Apply enterprise-level SEO optimization

### Completed Work

**Project Structure Created**:
- `03-ECOMMERCE-OF-THE-CULTURE/` main directory
- Page-specific folders: `homepage/`, `lookbook/`, `shop/`, `product/`, `cart/`, `checkout/`
- Shared resources: `shared/css/`, `images/`, `docs/`
- Documentation: `README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT-LOG.md`

**Homepage Implementation**:
- Copied foundation from 02-LANDING-PAGE
- Removed email contact section
- Added grosgrain label element with brand ethos text

- Text overlay with gradient clip for texture effect
- Mobile-responsive sizing and padding
- Brand ethos: "Drawing inspiration from optimism & ingenuity found within decentralization..."

### Technical Decisions

**Folder Structure Logic**:
- **Page-specific folders**: Allow isolated development and iteration

**Priority Items**:

2. Create lookbook page with product imagery
3. Develop product catalog structure
4. Plan shopping cart functionality

**Architecture Considerations**:
- Navigation approach: Inline content links vs. discrete menu
