# QA FAILURE LOG - OF THE CULTURE

## Purpose
Track critical QA failures to improve testing processes and prevent similar issues in future deployments.

## Failure #001 - Conditional Bag Visibility
**Date:** September 5, 2025  
**Session:** Cart System Implementation  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  

### What Failed
- **Feature:** Conditional bag visibility on lookbook/catalogue pages
- **Expected Behavior:** Bag indicator appears on homepage/lookbook/catalogue when cart has items
- **Actual Behavior:** Works on homepage, fails on lookbook/catalogue pages
- **Impact:** Core feature completely non-functional on 2/3 target pages

### Root Cause Analysis
**QA Testing Methodology Failure:**
1. ✅ Tested file integration (cart-manager.js, cart.css included)
2. ✅ Tested CSS integration (stylesheets linked properly)
3. ❌ **FAILED TO TEST ACTUAL FUNCTIONALITY** - Never verified behavior in browser
4. ❌ **FAILED TO TEST USER JOURNEY** - Never tested add-to-cart → navigate → verify visibility
5. ❌ **FAILED TO TEST EDGE CASES** - Different page contexts, path detection logic

**Technical Root Cause:** TBD (under investigation with debug logging)

### Process Improvements Required
1. **Behavioral Testing Mandatory:** Every feature must be tested in actual browser environment
2. **User Journey Testing:** Complete end-to-end user flows must be verified
3. **Cross-Page State Testing:** Features affecting multiple pages require navigation testing
4. **Debug-First Approach:** Add logging/debugging before marking features complete
5. **QA Checklist:** Formal checklist for each feature type (UI, state management, navigation, etc.)

### Action Items
- [ ] Fix conditional bag visibility bug
- [ ] Implement proper behavioral QA testing process
- [ ] Create feature-specific QA checklists
- [ ] Establish "definition of done" criteria for each feature type
- [ ] Require browser testing before marking any UI feature complete

### Lessons Learned
- **File integration ≠ Feature functionality**
- **Code presence ≠ Code execution**
- **Testing infrastructure ≠ Testing user experience**
- **Never declare success without actual behavioral verification**

## QA Process Improvements

### New Testing Standards (Effective Immediately)

#### 1. Behavioral Testing Requirements
- Every UI feature must be tested in browser
- Every state change must be verified visually
- Every user journey must be completed end-to-end
- Console errors must be checked and resolved

#### 2. Cross-Page Features
- Test navigation between all affected pages
- Verify state persistence across page transitions
- Test all path contexts (homepage, nested pages, product pages)
- Verify responsive behavior on mobile and desktop

#### 3. Definition of Done Checklist
**For UI Features:**
- [ ] Code implemented and integrated
- [ ] Browser testing completed successfully
- [ ] User journey tested end-to-end
- [ ] Cross-page functionality verified
- [ ] Console errors resolved
- [ ] Mobile/desktop responsive testing completed
- [ ] Edge cases tested and documented

**For State Management Features:**
- [ ] LocalStorage/persistence verified
- [ ] State updates tested across all trigger conditions
- [ ] Cross-page state synchronization verified
- [ ] Error handling tested
- [ ] Memory leaks checked (if applicable)

#### 4. QA Documentation
- Every feature must document expected behavior
- Every test must document actual results
- Failures must be documented with reproduction steps
- Success criteria must be clearly defined before implementation

### Accountability
- No feature is complete until behavioral testing passes
- QA failures must be documented in this log
- Process improvements must be implemented before continuing
- Team lead must approve any exceptions to testing standards
