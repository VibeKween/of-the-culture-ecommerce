**Handoff Date**: September 5, 2025  
**Previous Session**: Session 10 - Complete Cart System Implementation  
**Next Focus**: Cart Styling, Aesthetic Refinement, and Visual Polish  
**Branch**: cart-development-safe (ready for styling work)  
**Status**: Cart functionality complete, ready for visual enhancement

## Session Context

You are continuing development of the OF THE CULTURE ecommerce site. In Session 10, we successfully built a complete shopping cart system from scratch and organized the entire image architecture. The cart is fully functional across all 8 pages. Now we move to the styling and aesthetic refinement phase.

## Current Architecture Status

### ‚úÖ Completed in Session 10

**Complete Cart System Built:**
- Full shopping cart functionality with LocalStorage persistence
- Add to cart, quantity controls, item removal, checkout flow
- Dynamic cart modal with responsive design and consistent rendering
- Real-time cart indicator showing item count and total value  
- Mobile sticky cart indicator with smooth animations
- Cross-page cart state synchronization working perfectly

**Core Files Created:**
- `/shared/js/cart-manager.js` - Complete cart functionality (400+ lines)
- `/shared/css/cart.css` - Comprehensive cart styling system
- `/images/products/product-pages/` - Centralized image architecture
- All 8 pages updated for consistent cart rendering

**Critical Bug Fixes Completed:**
- Cart quantity bug fixed (minus button works for quantities above 5)
- Cart layout inconsistency resolved across all page contexts
- Product image display issues resolved with organized structure

### üéØ Ready for Session 11: Cart Styling Phase

The cart works perfectly but needs aesthetic refinement to match the ultra-minimal OF THE CULTURE brand aesthetic. Current cart styling is functional but could be more visually polished.

## Technical Context

### Current Cart CSS Architecture (`/shared/css/cart.css`)

**Cart Modal Structure:**
```css
.cart-overlay {
    /* Fixed position overlay with backdrop blur */
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);
    backdrop-filter: blur(6px) saturate(1.1);
}

.cart-sidebar {
    /* Slides in from right edge */
    width: 50vw; /* Desktop */
    max-width: 500px;
    transform: translateX(100%);
    transition: transform 0.35s cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1);
}
```

**Current Styling Elements:**
- Cart header with close button
- Scrollable cart items area
- Quantity controls with +/- buttons
- Remove item functionality
- Cart footer with subtotal and checkout button
- Mobile responsive (85vw width on mobile)

### Brand Design System Context

**OF THE CULTURE Aesthetic:**
```css
/* Core Brand Colors */
--color-black: #000000    /* Primary text and backgrounds */
--color-white: #FFFFFF    /* Background and inverted text */
--color-gold: #C19A4B     /* Accent color for emphasis */
```

**Typography:**
- Primary font: JetBrains Mono (monospace aesthetic)
- Minimal, clean typography with intentional spacing
- Ultra-minimal approach: "craft over noise, fewer, better, slower"

**Existing Visual Patterns:**
- 600px max-width centered layouts
- Massive whitespace for emphasis
- Single-column, mobile-first responsive
- Grosgrain label signature element (repeating texture)
- Subtle hover states with gold accent color
