## Immediate Session #004 Priorities

### 🔥 PRIORITY 1: Restore Gallery Sizing (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Gallery containers accidentally simplified at end of Session #003  
**Solution**: Restore the working large gallery CSS from mid-session:

```css
/* RESTORE THIS EXACT WORKING CODE */
.lookbook-gallery {
    /* Full viewport width breakout */
    width: calc(100vw - 40px);
    margin-left: calc(-50vw + 50% + 20px);
    
    /* Large containers - restore from successful work */
    max-width: 2200px;  /* Base: 2200px */
    padding: 0 60px;
    gap: 60px;
    
    /* Responsive progression */
    /* Desktop: 1800px */  
    /* Large Desktop: 2000px */
    /* Ultra-Wide: 2400px */
}
```

### 🎯 PRIORITY 2: Final Polish & Testing
- **Cross-browser testing**: Verify gallery displays correctly
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Test single-column mobile layout  
- **Navigation functionality**: Test all directory links
- **Performance check**: Ensure sub-2 second load times maintained

### 🎯 PRIORITY 3: Documentation Completion
- **Session Summary**: Complete Session #003 documentation
- **Feature Status Update**: Mark lookbook as production-ready
- **Next Phase Planning**: Prepare for Session #004 (Product Pages)

## Technical Architecture Status

### ✅ Confirmed Working
- **02-LANDING-PAGE Foundation**: Perfect alignment and spacing
- **Directory Navigation**: Proper centering and mobile nesting
- **Image Containers**: 4:5 aspect ratio with premium interactions
- **Responsive Grid**: Clean 2-column desktop, single-column mobile
- **Footer Links**: Proper hover functionality matching homepage

### 🔧 Partially Working (Needs Restoration)
- **Gallery Sizing**: Containers working but reduced from optimal large sizes
- **Full-Width Breakout**: Technique working but may need fine-tuning

### 📋 Ready for Next Phase
- **Web3 Integration Points**: Data attributes and API placeholders ready
- **Performance Architecture**: Lazy loading and async script loading implemented
- **SEO Foundation**: Complete structured data and meta tags

## Session #004 Success Criteria

### ✅ Must Complete
1. **Gallery Restoration**: Large impactful images like ALD reference
2. **Cross-Device Testing**: Perfect display on mobile, tablet, desktop
3. **Performance Verification**: Maintain sub-2 second load times
4. **Navigation Polish**: Seamless directory-style navigation

### 🎯 Should Complete  
1. **Documentation**: Complete Session #003 summary
2. **Feature Roadmap**: Update Phase 3 status to complete
3. **Session Handoff**: Prepare for Session #005 (Product Pages)

### 🔮 Could Complete (Time Permitting)
1. **Shop Page Enhancement**: More detailed coming soon content
2. **Analytics Integration**: Add GA4/Meta Pixel placeholders
3. **Product Page Planning**: Begin Session #005 preparation

## Key Learnings & Notes

### ✅ What Worked Perfectly
- **02-LANDING-PAGE Foundation**: Perfect choice for maintaining alignment
- **Gallery Breakout Technique**: Successfully breaks 600px page constraint
- **Directory Navigation**: Creates perfect nested hierarchy feel
- **Responsive Scaling**: Clean progression across all device sizes

### ⚠️ What Needs Attention

- **Breakout Technique**: Sensitive to changes, document exact working implementation
- **Mobile Spacing**: Directory navigation spacing requires precise adjustment

### 🧠 Architecture Decisions Made
- **Pure HTML/CSS Maintained**: No build tools, perfect for scaling
- **Component-Based CSS**: Reusable patterns across pages
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core experience works, features enhance
- **Web3-Ready**: Built for future crypto/MFT integration
