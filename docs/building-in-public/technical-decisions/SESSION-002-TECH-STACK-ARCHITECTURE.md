# üîß Session #002: Tech Stack & Architecture Decisions

**Date**: August 22, 2025  
**Project**: OF THE CULTURE Ecommerce Microsite  
**Status**: Architecture Planning Complete ‚úÖ

## Executive Summary

Session #002 focused on critical technology stack and site architecture decisions for scaling OF THE CULTURE from homepage foundation to full ecommerce experience. Key decisions finalized backend approach, payment integration strategy, and future web3 readiness.

## Core Technical Decisions

### üéØ 1. Frontend Architecture: Pure HTML/CSS Maintained

**DECISION**: Continue pure HTML/CSS approach established in Session #001

**Reasoning**:
- Aligns with "craft over noise" brand philosophy
- Homepage foundation proves approach works at enterprise scale
- Sub-2 second load times maintained without build tools
- GitHub Pages deployment simplicity preserved
- SEO and performance goals already achieved

**Implementation**:
- Maintain existing CSS component system (`shared/css/main.css`)
- Page-specific folder structure for modular development
- Mobile-first responsive patterns (600px max-width, 768px breakpoint)
- JavaScript only when absolutely necessary (cart management, API integration)

### üè™ 2. Backend & Commerce: Shopify Integration

**DECISION**: Shopify Basic ($39/month) as primary ecommerce backend

**Key Factors**:
- **Cost-efficient**: $39/month vs Enterprise requirements for white-label checkout
- **Professional infrastructure**: Industry-standard backend (same as Aim√© Leon Dore reference)
- **Payment variety**: Apple Pay, Google Pay, traditional cards, PayPal built-in
- **Future ecosystem access**: App integrations, analytics, marketing tools
- **5-product scale**: Perfect for launch scope with unlimited growth potential

**Checkout Experience**:
- Brief redirect to styled Shopify checkout (checkout.shopify.com)
- Heavy branding customization to maintain OF THE CULTURE aesthetic
- Return to custom confirmation page on primary domain
- Clear messaging about secure checkout process

### üí≥ 3. Payment Strategy: Multi-Phase Approach

#### Phase 1: Traditional Commerce (Launch Ready)
- **Shopify Payments**: Primary processor with competitive rates (2.9% + 30¬¢)
- **Apple Pay**: Mobile-optimized one-tap purchases
- **Google Pay**: Android optimization
- **Credit/Debit Cards**: Standard payment options
- **PayPal**: Wide user adoption support

#### Phase 2: Web3 Integration (Future Innovation)
- **MFT (Meta Fungible Token)** integration via custom developer solution
- **Hybrid checkout options**: Traditional + web3 payments
- **Digital provenance**: Each physical piece paired with unique digital token
- **Creator royalties**: Built-in resale value capture
- **Community building**: Token ownership as brand community access

### üé® 4. Design System: Component-Based CSS Architecture

**Established Components** (from Session #001):
- `.wordmark` - SVG brand identity treatment
- `.directory-nav` / `.directory-link` - Navigation system
- `.grosgrain-block` / `.grosgrain-text` - Signature brand element
- `.cultural-header` - Gold accent styling
- `.footer` - Consistent footer treatment

**New Commerce Components** (to develop):
- `.product-card` - Grid-based product presentation
- `.product-gallery` - Multi-image product display
- `.size-selector` - Clothing size selection interface
- `.price-display` - Consistent pricing typography
- `.cta-button` - Primary action buttons (Add to Cart, etc.)
- `.cart-indicator` - Shopping cart status display

### üåê 5. Global Site Architecture

**Navigation Strategy**:
- **Shared header/footer** across all pages for consistency
- **Internal site retention** - all commerce flows stay within OF THE CULTURE domain
- **Directory-style navigation** maintaining file-system aesthetic
- **Mobile-first touch interactions** for commerce actions

**URL Structure**:
```
/ (homepage - brand manifesto)
/pages/lookbook/ (visual product showcase)
/pages/shop/ (product catalog)
/pages/product/[item-slug] (individual product pages)
/pages/cart/ (cart management)
/checkout/ (Shopify redirect, returns to confirmation)
```

## Reference Analysis: Aim√© Leon Dore Inspiration
