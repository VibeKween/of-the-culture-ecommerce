# Building in Public Documentation

## Purpose

This folder contains content designed for public consumption - documentation of our development journey that can be adapted for blog posts, social media, newsletters, or integrated directly into the OF THE CULTURE site as a development journal.

## Philosophy

"Building in public" aligns perfectly with OF THE CULTURE's ethos of transparency, intentional craft, and community engagement. By documenting our process openly, we:

- **Share knowledge** with other developers and entrepreneurs
- **Build community** around the brand and development process  
- **Demonstrate values** of thoughtful, intentional creation
- **Create content** that can drive engagement and brand awareness
- **Document decisions** for future reference and team onboarding
