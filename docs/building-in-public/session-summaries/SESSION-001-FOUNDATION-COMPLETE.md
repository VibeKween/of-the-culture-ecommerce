## The Journey So Far

### Where We Started
A vision for an ultra-minimal ecommerce experience that maintains the philosophical depth and aesthetic integrity of the OF THE CULTURE brand.

- The importance of building comprehensive systems before rushing to features

### Key Decisions Made
- **Pure HTML/CSS approach**: Maintaining simplicity while achieving professional results
- **Directory-style navigation**: File-system aesthetic aligned with digital culture positioning
- **Grosgrain textile elements**: Physical garment aesthetics translated to digital experience
- **Documentation-first development**: Process standards that enable sustainable scaling

## Technical Milestones

### Visual & UX

## Reflections

### What Worked Well

- **Design system consistency**: Maintaining brand integrity while adding functionality
- **Cross-site strategy**: Treating all Tuku Group properties as connected ecosystem

### Lessons Learned
- **Spacing is everything**: Visual balance requires as much attention as functionality
- **Web conventions enhance minimalism**: Traditional elements like blue links can strengthen rather than compromise aesthetic
