## üèóÔ∏è DEVELOPMENT BEST PRACTICES - CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Code Architecture Standards (Per CLAUDE.md)
**‚ùå NEVER USE:**
- `!important` declarations unless absolutely necessary
- Patch-first approaches that mask underlying issues
- Duplicate code to "fix" inconsistencies
- Hacky workarounds that create technical debt

**‚úÖ ALWAYS APPLY:**
- **Root cause analysis first** - Understand WHY issues exist before coding
- **System impact analysis** - Determine underlying behavior causing symptoms  
- **Design minimal solutions** - Address core problems, not visible symptoms
- **Preserve clean architecture** - Solutions must align with existing patterns

### Development Methodology (Proven Successful)
1. **Identify Root Cause** - Understand WHY the issue exists before touching code
2. **Analyze System Impact** - Determine what underlying behavior causes the symptom
3. **Design Minimal Solution** - Address core problem, not just visible symptom
4. **Preserve Clean Architecture** - Solutions must align with existing patterns

**Example from Session 14:** Homepage wordmark sizing fixed by standardizing HTML structure rather than complex CSS patches - one clean architectural change eliminated multiple previous fix attempts.

### Code Quality Standards
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - No build tools, maintain simplicity
- **Mobile-first responsive** - Single breakpoint at 768px
- **Progressive enhancement** - Features work without JavaScript
- **Semantic HTML** - Accessibility and SEO compliance
- **Performance-first** - Sub-2 second load times non-negotiable

### CSS Architecture Rules
- **Custom properties** for consistent theming
- **Single-column, centered layout** patterns  
- **Component-based styles** with clear separation
- **No framework dependencies** - maintain control and performance
- **Systematic naming conventions** - `.page`, `.shop-page`, `.product-page`
