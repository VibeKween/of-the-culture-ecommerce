- Test mobile shop page image sizing across different devices
- Confirm visual improvement meets brand standards
- Resize if needed (current: 160%, easily adjustable)

### 2. **Quality Assurance Verification**
**Cross-Device Testing**: Validate mobile click shadow resolution
- Test product card interactions on various mobile browsers
- Confirm zero visual artifacts on tap interactions
- Verify desktop hover effects still function properly

### 3. **Feature Development Decision Point**
**Next Major Component**: Choose development direction based on business priorities

**Option A - Commerce Functionality**:
- Shopping cart page implementation
- Checkout flow development  
- Payment integration (traditional â†’ crypto)

**Option B - Content Enhancement**:
- Product photography integration
- Enhanced product descriptions
- Additional product catalog expansion

**Option C - Technical Infrastructure**:
- Backend integration activation
- Analytics/tracking implementation
- Performance optimization audit

## Expected Session 008 Flow

1. **Validation Phase** (15-20 minutes)
   - User tests mobile image sizing
   - Confirms click shadow resolution
   - Provides sizing adjustment feedback if needed

2. **Direction Setting** (10-15 minutes)
   - Discuss business priorities for next major component
   - Choose between commerce functionality, content, or infrastructure
   - Set clear development objectives

3. **Implementation Phase** (60-90 minutes)
   - Execute chosen development direction
   - Maintain quality standards and mobile-first approach
   - Document progress in building-in-public format

## Technical Context for Claude

### Project Architecture
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: No build tools, frameworks, or dependencies
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive across all breakpoints (768px primary)
- **ALD-Inspired**: Clean, minimal aesthetic with premium hover interactions
- **Web3-Ready**: Architecture supports future crypto integration without rebuilds

### Code Quality Standards
- **Ultra-minimal**: "Craft over noise" philosophy in all implementations
- **Performance First**: Sub-2 second load times maintained
- **Documentation**: All changes documented in both technical and building-in-public formats
- **Mobile Excellence**: Touch-first interaction design with cross-platform compatibility

### Recent Learning: Mobile Touch Interactions
Key insight from Session 007: Mobile hover state activation requires explicit media query protection. Always use `(hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` for desktop-only effects and `(hover: none) and (pointer: coarse)` for mobile touch protection.

## Success Metrics for Session 008

- âœ… **Mobile Enhancement Validated**: User confirms 160% image sizing meets expectations
- âœ… **Quality Assurance Complete**: Cross-device testing confirms shadow resolution
- âœ… **Next Development Phase Started**: Clear direction set and initial implementation begun
- âœ… **Documentation Updated**: All progress recorded in development log and building-in-public
