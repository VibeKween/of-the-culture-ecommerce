## 🎨 Design Analysis & Research

### **ALD Product Page Analysis Completed**
**Key Patterns Identified**:
- 3-column layout with centered product images for maximum focus
- Left column dedicated to product information and expandable specifications  
- Right column isolates purchase functionality in light grey treatment
- Thin typography with refined spacing creates premium editorial aesthetic
- Accordion sections reduce visual clutter while maintaining information access
- Mobile experience uses full-width bottom treatment for purchase flow

**Implementation Results**:
- Successfully adapted ALD layout patterns while maintaining OF THE CULTURE minimal aesthetic
- Product images now use lookbook grid sizing (4:5 aspect ratio) for consistency
- Typography refined to thin weights with improved letter spacing and opacity
- Mobile cart experience enhanced with full-width light grey treatment

## 🚀 Current Site Status

**Key Pages Ready**:
- ✅ Homepage with grosgrain label
- ✅ Lookbook with image grid and interactive features  
- ✅ Product template with ALD-inspired layout (Terminal Aesthetics Cap showcases full implementation)
- ✅ Shop page structure (Coming Soon state)

**Testing Completed**:

## 📋 Next Session Priorities

### **Immediate Frontend Polish Tasks**
1. **Apply ALD Layout to Remaining Products**: Update all 7 remaining product pages with new layout
2. **Shop Catalog Development**: Create product grid displaying all SZN2526 items with navigation
3. **Typography Consistency**: Fine-tune font weights and spacing across all pages  
4. **Image System Enhancement**: Replace gradient placeholders with actual photography or enhanced visuals
5. **Micro-Interaction Polish**: Refine hover states, transitions, and loading animations

### **Suggested Session 6 Focus**
**Priority 1**: Complete visual consistency by applying ALD layout to all product pages  
**Priority 2**: Build functional shop catalog page with product grid and filtering  
**Priority 3**: Image integration strategy - actual photography vs enhanced placeholder system  
**Priority 4**: Cross-device testing and performance optimization  
**Priority 5**: Prepare for cart/checkout development in future sessions

## 🎛️ Key Technical Decisions Made

- **ALD Layout Adoption**: 3-column desktop provides superior product presentation vs 2-column
- **Mobile-First Cart**: Full-width bottom treatment offers better UX than floating overlay
- **Accordion Specifications**: Reduces visual clutter while maintaining information accessibility  
- **Typography Refinement**: Thin fonts (300-400 weight) create premium editorial aesthetic
