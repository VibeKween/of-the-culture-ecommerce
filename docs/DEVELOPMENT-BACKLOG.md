# Development Backlog - OF THE CULTURE Ecommerce

## High Priority Items

### Cart System Styling & Layout Refinement
**Priority**: High  
**Session Target**: Session 11 (Cart Styling Phase)  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation  

**Background:**
Cart functionality is complete and working across all 8 pages. However, visual styling and responsive layout need refinement for optimal UX.

**Current Issues:**
1. **Mobile Cart Positioning**: Cart not properly centered/anchored on mobile devices
2. **Desktop Right Rail**: Checkout button alignment affected by recent mobile fixes  
3. **Responsive Inconsistencies**: Different positioning behavior across device sizes
4. **Visual Polish**: Opportunity to enhance overall cart aesthetic while maintaining functionality

**Technical Context:**
- Cart system: `shared/js/cart-manager.js` (functional, don't modify)
- Cart styling: `shared/css/cart.css` (needs refinement)
- All 8 pages have consistent cart integration
- LocalStorage persistence working correctly

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Consistent cart positioning across all devices
- [ ] Proper right-rail anchor on desktop
- [ ] Maintained backdrop blur/opacity effects
- [ ] Smooth slide animations on all screen sizes
- [ ] Visual refinements aligned with OF THE CULTURE brand aesthetic
