# Development Process Notes

## Navigation Strategy - Internal Site Retention

**Requirement**: All subsequent pages (lookbook, catalogue, product pages, etc.) should keep users within the OF THE CULTURE microsite rather than linking externally.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Lookbook and catalogue pages use relative paths within this site structure
- Internal navigation maintains user engagement within commerce flow
- External links only for: Tuku Group parent company, legal requirements, payment processing

**Site Structure Planning**:
```
Homepage → Lookbook (internal)
Homepage → Catalogue (internal)
Catalogue → Product Pages (internal)
Product Pages → Cart (internal)
Cart → Checkout (internal)

External Links:
- Footer: Tuku Group, LLC → tukugroup.com
- Legal: Privacy/Terms (when required)
- Payment: Processor checkout (when required)
```
