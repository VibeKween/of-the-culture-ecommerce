# Development Process Notes

## Navigation Strategy - Internal Site Retention

**Requirement**: All subsequent pages (lookbook, catalogue, product pages, etc.) should keep users within the OF THE CULTURE microsite rather than linking externally.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Lookbook and catalogue pages use relative paths within this site structure
- Internal navigation maintains user engagement within commerce flow
- External links only for: Tuku Group parent company, legal requirements, payment processing

**Site Structure Planning**:
```
Homepage → Lookbook (internal)
Homepage → Catalogue (internal)
Catalogue → Product Pages (internal)
Product Pages → Cart (internal)
Cart → Checkout (internal)

External Links:
- Footer: Tuku Group, LLC → tukugroup.com
- Legal: Privacy/Terms (when required)
- Payment: Processor checkout (when required)
```

## SEO Process Standardization

### For All Future Pages (Mandatory)
Apply SEO recommendations from `docs/features/SEO-TECHNICAL-BACKLOG.md` as standard development process:

**Page Creation Checklist**:
- [ ] Extended title with keywords and page purpose
- [ ] Comprehensive meta description with target keywords  
- [ ] Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags
- [ ] JSON-LD structured data appropriate to page type
- [ ] Semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy
- [ ] Descriptive alt text for all images
- [ ] Internal linking strategy implementation

**Page-Specific Schema Types**:
- **Lookbook**: ImageGallery, CreativeWork
- **Product Pages**: Product, Offer, Organization
- **Category/Shop**: CollectionPage, ItemList
- **Cart/Checkout**: WebPage with appropriate actions

### Retrospective SEO Implementation Required

**01-LANDING-PAGE and 02-LANDING-PAGE** need same SEO treatment:
- Apply enhanced meta tags and structured data
- Add semantic HTML improvements
- Implement Open Graph/Twitter Cards
- Add JSON-LD Organization/Website schemas
- Update documentation and commit/push changes

**Priority**: Medium (after current ecommerce site foundation is complete)
**Timing**: Session dedicated to workspace-wide SEO standardization

## Development Workflow Updates

### Standard Page Development Process
1. **Plan**: Review SEO requirements for page type
2. **Build**: Implement page with SEO foundation from start
3. **Test**: Validate structured data, mobile responsiveness
4. **Document**: Update feature roadmap and session archives
5. **Deploy**: Commit/push with comprehensive commit messages

### Quality Assurance Checklist
- [ ] SEO meta tags complete and accurate
- [ ] Structured data validates in Google Rich Results Test
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive design verified
- [ ] Internal linking maintains site retention strategy
- [ ] Performance impact assessed (Core Web Vitals)
- [ ] Accessibility compliance maintained

## Backend & Commerce Architecture (Session #002)

### Final Tech Stack Decisions

**Backend Platform**: Shopify Basic ($39/month)
- Professional ecommerce infrastructure 
- Apple Pay, Google Pay, traditional payment support
- Cost-efficient alternative to Enterprise white-label checkout
- Future ecosystem integration capabilities (apps, analytics, marketing)
- Brief checkout redirect to styled Shopify domain, returns to custom confirmation

**Payment Strategy**: Multi-phase approach
- **Phase 1**: Traditional commerce (Shopify Payments, Apple Pay, cards, PayPal)
- **Phase 2**: Web3 integration via custom MFT (Meta Fungible Token) system
- Hybrid checkout options when MFT system ready
- Digital + physical asset bundling for unique value proposition

**Frontend Architecture**: Pure HTML/CSS maintained
- Continue Session #001 approach (no build tools)
- CSS component system expanded for commerce elements
- JavaScript only for cart management and API integration
- Mobile-first responsive patterns preserved

### MFT Integration Planning

**Developer Context**: Custom Meta Fungible Token system in development
**Strategic Value**: Early web3 fashion adoption, community building, creator royalties
**Timeline**: Phase 2 implementation after traditional commerce launch
**Architecture**: Designed to support dual payment options without frontend rework

**Reference**: See `docs/building-in-public/technical-decisions/SESSION-002-TECH-STACK-ARCHITECTURE.md` for complete technical decisions and analysis.

### API Extensibility Architecture

**Universal API Integration Capability**: Pure HTML/CSS + JavaScript approach supports unlimited third-party API integration
- **Current readiness**: Fetch API, async/await, modern JavaScript patterns
- **Future integrations**: Shopify Admin API, crypto price oracles, email marketing, social media APIs
- **Implementation strategy**: Build API-ready components now, activate services when needed
- **Zero rebuilds**: Component architecture designed for API data injection without structural changes

**Common future API scenarios**: Inventory management, email marketing (Klaviyo/Mailchimp), analytics (GA4, Mixpanel), social media integration, blockchain/web3 services, shipping and fulfillment automation.

**Reference**: See `docs/building-in-public/technical-decisions/API-EXTENSIBILITY-FRAMEWORK.md` for complete API architecture planning.

### Performance Guarantee

**Zero page load impact from API integrations**: Architecture designed to maintain sub-2 second load times regardless of API integrations added
- **Static-first loading**: Page renders instantly with HTML/CSS, APIs enhance afterward
- **Lazy loading strategy**: API services load only when needed, never blocking initial page load
- **Progressive enhancement**: APIs enhance user experience without breaking core functionality
- **Graceful fallbacks**: Site works perfectly if any API fails or is unavailable

**Reference**: See `docs/building-in-public/technical-decisions/PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATION-STRATEGY.md` for complete performance architecture and implementation guidelines.

## Tech Stack Audit & Optimization Planning

**Comprehensive architecture review required**: After complete site build and user data collection, conduct full tech stack audit to optimize based on real UX/UI requirements and performance data

**Audit Trigger Conditions**:
- Complete ecommerce site functionality implemented (all pages, commerce flows)
- Minimum 30-90 days of real user interaction data collected
- Performance baselines established across desktop and mobile
- Business requirements validated through actual usage patterns

**Audit Components**:
- **Frontend decision impact analysis**: Quantify performance impact of pure HTML/CSS approach vs alternatives
- **API integration efficiency review**: Evaluate API architecture against actual usage patterns and optimization opportunities
- **Web3 backend strategy optimization**: Data-driven optimization of wallet integration and payment methods
- **Cost-benefit analysis**: Current tech stack efficiency vs alternatives (Shopify Basic vs Plus vs custom backend)

**Expected Outcomes**: Prioritized optimization roadmap with ROI projections, implementation timeline, and risk assessment for recommended architecture changes.

**Reference**: See `docs/building-in-public/technical-decisions/TECH-STACK-AUDIT-FRAMEWORK.md` for comprehensive audit methodology and implementation framework.

## Analytics & SEO Backend Integration

**Strategic placeholder implementation required**: Analytics and SEO backend integration planned to leverage Shopify's built-in capabilities while adding custom enhancements for web3 and advanced tracking

**Analytics Backend Strategy**:
- **Shopify Built-In Analytics**: Order tracking, customer behavior, product performance, mobile insights (included with Basic plan)
- **Advanced Analytics Placeholders**: Google Analytics 4, Meta Pixel, custom web3 interaction tracking
- **Web3 Analytics**: Wallet connection rates, crypto payment success, MFT interaction tracking
- **Performance Impact**: Zero page load impact using same lazy-loading strategy as API integrations

**SEO Backend Requirements**:
- **Current Foundation**: Enterprise-level SEO already implemented in Session #001 (JSON-LD, meta tags, structured data)
- **Dynamic SEO Needs**: Product page titles/descriptions, enhanced structured data, XML sitemap management
- **Shopify Integration**: Leverage Liquid templates for dynamic content, metafields for custom SEO data
- **Template System**: Dynamic meta tags and structured data without performance impact

**Implementation Priority**: High - Include essential placeholders (GA4, Meta Pixel, dynamic SEO templates) in Session #003 development

**Reference**: See `docs/building-in-public/technical-decisions/ANALYTICS-SEO-BACKEND-STRATEGY.md` for complete integration strategy and implementation templates.
