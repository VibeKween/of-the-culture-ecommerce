## Session #005 Priorities

### ðŸ”¥ PRIORITY 1: Individual Product Pages
**Objective**: Create individual product detail pages for each lookbook item  
**Foundation**: Use established component library and grid architecture

**Product Pages to Create**:
1. **Crypto Nomad Hoodie** - `/pages/product/crypto-nomad-hoodie/`
2. **Git Commit Tee** - `/pages/product/git-commit-tee/`
3. **Remix Culture Crewneck** - `/pages/product/remix-culture-crewneck/`
4. **Digital Sovereignty Jacket** - `/pages/product/digital-sovereignty-jacket/`
5. **Terminal Aesthetics Cap** - `/pages/product/terminal-aesthetics-cap/`

**Technical Requirements**:
- Build on lookbook component foundation (grid, navigation, footer)
- Implement product image galleries with ALD-inspired layouts
- Create product information sections (details, sizing, pricing)
- Add to cart functionality preparation (state management ready)
- Maintain pure HTML/CSS architecture with API-ready data attributes

### ðŸŽ¯ PRIORITY 2: Product Page Template System
**Create Reusable Template**: Standardized product page structure for future products
**Component Integration**: Use documented grid, navigation, and footer components
**Performance Optimization**: Maintain sub-2 second load times across all product pages

### ðŸŽ¯ PRIORITY 3: Shopping Cart Foundation
**Objective**: Prepare shopping cart functionality architecture  
**Technical Approach**: localStorage state management with API extension points
**Integration Points**: Connect with Shopify Basic backend preparation

## Technical Architecture Status

### âœ… Confirmed Production Ready
- **Grid Component**: Protected with comprehensive documentation and CSS warnings
- **Navigation Component**: Left-aligned with surgical main.css overrides documented
- **Footer Component**: Hover-only styling standardized across site
- **Mobile Responsive**: Strict media query containment preventing CSS bleeding
- **Cross-Device Testing**: Verified perfect display on desktop, tablet, mobile

### ðŸ”§ Ready for Extension

- **Data Attributes**: `data-product` attributes implemented for tracking
- **API Integration Points**: Backend connection points documented and ready
- **Web3 Preparation**: Wallet authentication and stablecoin payment foundations established

### ðŸ“‹ Component Library Available

- **Navigation Patterns**: Directory-style with homepage alignment solutions
- **Footer Standards**: Hover-only link styling with proper opacity transitions
- **CSS Protection**: Documented methodologies for preventing cascade conflicts

## Session #005 Success Criteria

### âœ… Must Complete
1. **5 Individual Product Pages**: Complete product detail pages for all lookbook items
2. **Product Template**: Reusable template system for future product additions
3. **Component Integration**: Proper use of established grid, navigation, footer components
4. **Cross-Device Testing**: Perfect responsive behavior across all devices

### ðŸŽ¯ Should Complete  
1. **Shopping Cart Foundation**: State management architecture for cart functionality
2. **Product Gallery System**: ALD-inspired product image display patterns
3. **API Integration Prep**: Backend connection architecture for commerce functionality

### ðŸ”® Could Complete (Time Permitting)
1. **Advanced Product Features**: Size selection, color variants, detailed specifications
2. **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading for product images and content
3. **Session #006 Handoff**: Shopping cart development and Shopify integration planning

## Key Learnings & Architecture Guidelines

### âœ… What Works Perfectly (From Session #004)
- **Protected Grid System**: CSS protection methodology prevents accidental modifications
- **Surgical CSS Overrides**: Targeted specificity for main.css modifications without breaking other pages
- **Component Documentation**: Clear specifications enable consistent implementation
- **Mobile-First Discipline**: Strict media query containment prevents responsive bleeding

### ðŸ”§ Best Practices Established
- **Component Isolation**: Never use generic selectors affecting multiple components
- **CSS Specificity Management**: Document all main.css overrides with clear reasoning
- **Cross-Device Testing**: Always verify mobile media query containment
- **Documentation Standards**: Update component specs when making modifications

### ðŸ§  Architecture Decisions for Product Pages
- **Template System**: Build reusable product page template using component library
- **Performance First**: Maintain sub-2 second load times with progressive enhancement
- **API-Ready**: Design with backend integration and web3 preparation in mind
- **Pure HTML/CSS**: Continue zero-build-tool approach for maximum scalability

## Development Environment Notes

### Component Library Usage
```html
<!-- Grid Component - Copy complete structure -->
<section class="lookbook-gallery">
    <div class="gallery-container">
        <!-- content here -->
    </div>
</section>

<!-- Navigation Component - Use with alignment overrides -->
<section class="block navigation">
    <nav class="directory-nav">
        <a href="#" class="directory-link">page :: description</a>
    </nav>
</section>
```

### CSS Protection Guidelines
- Never modify `.lookbook-gallery` or `.gallery-container` core rules
- Use surgical overrides following Session #004 methodology
- Always contain mobile rules within proper media queries
- Document any main.css modifications with clear reasoning

### File Structure for Product Pages
```
pages/product/
â”œâ”€â”€ crypto-nomad-hoodie/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ product.css
â”œâ”€â”€ git-commit-tee/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ product.css
â””â”€â”€ [additional products...]
```

## Next Session Preparation

### Session #006 Planning: Shopping Cart & Commerce
- **Shopping Cart Functionality**: Complete cart system with localStorage
- **Shopify Integration**: Backend commerce connection implementation
- **Payment Processing**: Traditional payment methods with web3 preparation

## ðŸš€ Session #005 Start Prompt

**Copy this prompt to begin Session #005:**

```
Hello! I'm continuing development of the OF THE CULTURE ecommerce microsite. This is Session #005 
focused on creating individual product pages and establishing product template systems.

**OBJECTIVES FOR THIS SESSION:**
Session #004 delivered a production-ready lookbook with protected component architecture. Now we need 
to create individual product detail pages that build on this foundation while maintaining the 
established design system and performance standards.

**Current Project State:**
- Repository: https://github.com/VibeKween/of-the-culture-ecommerce
- Live Site: https://vibekween.github.io/of-the-culture-ecommerce/pages/lookbook/
- Project Path: /Users/falonbahal/Desktop/DEVELOPMENT/TUKU-GROUP/03-ECOMMERCE-OF-THE-CULTURE

**Session #004 Achievements:**
- Production-ready lookbook with ALD-inspired 2-column gallery âœ…
- Protected component library (grid, navigation, footer) âœ…  
- Cross-device responsive design verified âœ…
- Mobile CSS bleeding issues resolved âœ…
- Component documentation and protection guidelines established âœ…

**Session #005 Priorities:**
1. ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL: Create 5 individual product detail pages for all lookbook items
2. ðŸŽ¯ Build reusable product page template using established component library
3. ðŸ“± Ensure perfect responsive behavior and performance across all product pages
4. ðŸ›’ Prepare shopping cart functionality architecture for Session #006

**Component Library Available:**
- Grid System: 1400px â†’ 2400px progressive enhancement (fully documented)
- Navigation: Left-aligned directory style with main.css override solutions  
- Footer: Hover-only link styling standardized across site

Please review the Session #005 handoff documentation in docs/SESSION-005-HANDOFF.md 
and begin by creating the first product page using the established component foundation.

IMPORTANT: Use the protected component library - never modify the core grid system established in Session #004.
