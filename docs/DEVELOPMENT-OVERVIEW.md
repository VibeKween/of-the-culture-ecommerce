# OF THE CULTURE Ecommerce - Development Overview

## Project Context

**Brand**: OF THE CULTURE  
**Project Type**: Small-batch clothing studio ecommerce microsite  
**Development Approach**: Page-by-page modular development  
**Design Philosophy**: Ultra-minimal, manifesto-style, "craft over noise"

## What We're Building

### 🎯 Core Mission
Create an ecommerce microsite for OF THE CULTURE that maintains the ultra-minimal, manifesto-driven aesthetic established in the brand's landing page while introducing commerce functionality for small-batch clothing sales.

### 🏪 Site Architecture (Planned)
1. **Homepage** (`/`) - Brand manifesto + commerce entry
2. **Lookbook** (`/lookbook`) - Visual product showcase
3. **Shop** (`/shop`) - Product catalog and selection
4. **Product Pages** (`/product/*`) - Individual item details
5. **Shopping Cart** (`/cart`) - Cart management and review
6. **Checkout** (`/checkout`) - Purchase completion flow
7. **Legal Pages** (`/privacy`, `/terms`) - Standard ecommerce policies

### 📦 Initial Product Plan
- **Launch Scale**: 5 carefully curated products
- **Product Type**: Limited-run apparel with digital culture references
- **Positioning**: "Not loud, not trend-driven, each piece a signal"

## Design System Foundation

### 🎨 Visual Identity
**Inherited from 02-LANDING-PAGE (OF THE CULTURE landing page)**
- **Typography**: JetBrains Mono (primary), Lekton (labels)
- **Colors**: Black (#000000), White (#FFFFFF), Gold (#C19A4B)
- **Layout**: 600px max-width, centered, mobile-first responsive
- **Spacing**: 80px vertical sections (60px on mobile)

### 🏷️ Signature Element: Grosgrain Label
**Purpose**: Brand ethos element that appears on physical garments  
**Aesthetic**: Clothing label texture with grosgrain ribbon pattern  
**Content**: Philosophy about decentralization, innovation, forward-thinking  
**Technical**: CSS gradient patterns with text clipping effects

### 📱 Responsive Approach
- **Mobile-First**: 16px base, scales to 18px on desktop
- **Breakpoint**: Single breakpoint at 768px
- **Touch-Friendly**: Commerce interactions optimized for mobile
- **Performance**: Sub-2 second load time target

## Development Strategy

### 🏗️ Modular Architecture
**Page-Specific Development**: Each page lives in its own folder
```
pages/
├── homepage/     # Brand manifesto + entry point
├── lookbook/     # Visual product showcase  
├── shop/         # Product catalog
├── product/      # Individual product pages
├── cart/         # Shopping cart management
└── checkout/     # Purchase flow
```

**Benefits**:

- Easy A/B testing and iteration
- Modular deployment options
- Clear separation of concerns
