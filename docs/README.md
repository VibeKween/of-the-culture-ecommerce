## How to Use This Documentation

### 📖 Reading Documentation
**For Understanding Project Context**:
- Start with `DEVELOPMENT-OVERVIEW.md` for big picture
- Review `FEATURE-ROADMAP.md` for development status
- Deep dive into session archives for implementation details

**For Contributing to Development**:
- Check roadmap for current priorities
- Review latest session archive for recent changes
- Follow development principles outlined in overview

### ✍️ Writing Documentation
**During Development Sessions**:
- Create new session archive for each development session
- Document decisions as they're made, not after
- Include code examples and file change explanations
- Plan next session objectives and priorities

**When Adding Features**:
- Update feature roadmap with new requirements
- Document technical decisions and alternative considerations
- Include testing approach and success criteria
- Update development overview if architecture changes

## Documentation Philosophy

### 🎯 Core Principles
1. **No-Context Clarity**: Anyone should understand from docs alone
2. **Decision Tracking**: Record why choices were made, not just what
3. **Living Documents**: Keep documentation current with implementation
4. **Learning Capture**: Document what works and what doesn't

### 📚 Information Architecture
**Hierarchical Structure**:
- **Overview Level**: Project context and current status
- **Feature Level**: Detailed specifications and roadmap
- **Session Level**: Implementation details and decisions
- **Reference Level**: Technical details and getting started

### 🔄 Maintenance Approach
**Regular Updates**:
- Session archives created after each development session
- Feature roadmap updated when priorities change
- Development overview updated when architecture evolves
- Documentation reviewed and cleaned up periodically
