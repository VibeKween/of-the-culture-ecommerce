# üåê Web3 Development Resumption Prompts

**Purpose**: Session startup prompts to resume web3 development at the appropriate time  
**Created**: August 22, 2025 (Session #002)  
**Project**: OF THE CULTURE Ecommerce Web3 Integration

## When to Use These Prompts

These prompts should be used when traditional commerce is stable and you're ready to begin web3 integration phases (typically Session #010+ based on current roadmap).

## Session Startup Context Prompt

```
I'm resuming development of the OF THE CULTURE ecommerce site and ready to begin web3 integration. 

Current Status:
- Traditional commerce is live and stable with Shopify Basic backend
- Pure HTML/CSS + JavaScript frontend architecture
- 5-product catalog launched with proven conversion rates
- Ready to add wallet authentication and stablecoin payment capabilities

Please review the web3 planning documentation and help me start implementation:

Key Documents:
1. docs/building-in-public/technical-decisions/WEB3-INFRASTRUCTURE-PLANNING.md
2. docs/features/FEATURE-ROADMAP.md (Phases 7-9: Web3 integration)
3. docs/building-in-public/technical-decisions/API-EXTENSIBILITY-FRAMEWORK.md

Web3 Requirements:
- Wallet authentication: MetaMask (Ethereum), Phantom (Solana), WalletConnect
- Stablecoin payments: USDC, USDT (ETH + SOL networks)
- MFT integration: Custom Meta Fungible Token system when ready
- Zero frontend rebuilds: Activate web3 features on existing architecture

Current architecture confirmation needed:
- Frontend: Pure HTML/CSS + JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Backend: Shopify Basic for traditional payments + web3 integration layer
- Components: Built with data-target attributes ready for wallet/crypto data

Please confirm web3 readiness and recommend Phase 7 (wallet authentication) implementation approach.
```
