- **Performance**: Zero page load impact guaranteed for all future integrations

**Component Strategy:**
- Build with `data-target` attributes for API data injection
- Include CSS classes for wallet-connected and API-enhanced states
- Use modular payment architecture supporting multiple methods
- Implement lazy loading patterns for performance optimization

**Reference Inspiration:**
- AimÃ© Leon Dore lookbook approach (https://www.aimeleondore.com/blogs/news/fall-winter-2025-lookbook)
- Product showcase patterns from their shop pages
- Mobile-first responsive commerce interactions
