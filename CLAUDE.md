# CLAUDE.md - 03-ECOMMERCE-OF-THE-CULTURE

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the OF THE CULTURE ecommerce site.

## Development Philosophy & Process

**CRITICAL: Root Cause Analysis First - No Patch-First Development**

When encountering any issue, always follow this refined process:

1. **Identify Root Cause** - Understand WHY the issue exists before touching any code
2. **Analyze System Impact** - Determine what underlying behavior is causing the symptom
3. **Design Minimal Solution** - Address the core problem, not just the visible symptom
4. **Preserve Clean Architecture** - Solutions must align with existing patterns and avoid tech debt

**❌ Avoid Patch-First Approaches:**
- No `!important` declarations unless absolutely necessary
- No arbitrary overrides or band-aid CSS fixes
- No duplicate code to "fix" inconsistencies
- No hacky workarounds that mask underlying issues

**✅ Preferred Solution Patterns:**
- Single-property fixes that address root causes
- Consistent application of existing CSS patterns
- Clean, maintainable code that improves the system
- Solutions that prevent similar future issues

**Example:** Font weight inconsistency between accordion headers was solved with `font-synthesis: none` (preventing browser font variations) rather than patching with font-weight overrides.

This methodology ensures sustainable code architecture, reduced technical debt, and cleaner, more maintainable solutions.

## Copy Update Methodology

**CRITICAL: Systematic Copy Updates - No Patch-First Content Changes**

When updating site copy (seasons, pricing, product names, navigation), always follow this process:

### 1. **Universal Changes First**
For global updates (seasons, brand terms, pricing), use systematic find/replace:
```bash
# Example: Season updates
find . -name "*.html" -exec sed -i '' 's/SZN2526/SZN2026/g' {} +
find . -name "*.js" -exec sed -i '' 's/SZN2526/SZN2026/g' {} +
```

### 2. **Cross-Reference Validation** 
- **Homepage navigation** → All destination pages
- **Product pricing** → Shop grid, product pages, cart system, JavaScript
- **Navigation links** → Bag/cart references, back/view links
- **Dynamic content** → Cart modal messaging, form states

### 3. **File Update Order**
1. Universal replacements (seasons, prices, brand terms)
2. Homepage (entry point - most critical)  
3. Navigation systems (shop, lookbook)
4. Product pages (individual updates)
5. JavaScript systems (cart, pricing, product IDs)
6. Modal/interactive copy (cart, forms)

### 4. **Quality Control Checklist**
- [ ] Global find/replace completed for universal changes
- [ ] Homepage navigation reflects all destination page updates  
- [ ] All pricing matches across: shop grid, product pages, cart system, JavaScript
- [ ] Season references consistent across all pages and systems
- [ ] Cart functionality preserved during navigation changes
- [ ] End-to-end user journey tested (Homepage → Shop → Product → Cart)

### **Copy Location Reference**
- **Master copy deck**: `COPY-DECK-MASTER.md` - Complete site copy reference
- **Hardcoded locations**: Homepage, shop, lookbook, product pages HTML
- **Dynamic content**: `shared/js/cart-manager.js` - Cart messaging and pricing
- **Interactive elements**: Modal copy, form labels, button states

**Root Cause Prevention:** This process prevents issues like homepage navigation showing outdated seasons when destination pages are updated individually.
