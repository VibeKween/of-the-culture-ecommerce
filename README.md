- **Typography**: JetBrains Mono (primary), Lekton (grosgrain labels)
- **Colors**: Black (#000000), White (#FFFFFF), Gold (#C19A4B)
- **Layout**: 600px max-width, centered, mobile-first responsive
- **Spacing**: 80px between sections (60px on mobile)

## Development Approach

**Page-by-Page Development**: Each page is developed in isolation within its own folder, allowing for:
- Isolated feature iteration
- Easy A/B testing
- Modular deployment options
- Clear separation of concerns

## Current Status

**Phase 1 - Homepage Foundation**: ✅ Complete
- Homepage with grosgrain label implementation
- Base CSS system with mobile optimization
- SVG wordmark integration

**Next Steps**:
- Add navigation links to future pages
- Develop lookbook page
- Build product catalog system
- Implement shopping cart functionality

## Technical Specifications

- **No build tools**: Pure HTML/CSS approach
- **Static deployment**: Ready for GitHub Pages or similar
- **Mobile optimization**: Responsive breakpoint at 768px
- **Font loading**: Google Fonts CDN (JetBrains Mono, Lekton)

## Launch Plan

Initial launch with 5 products across:
1. Landing page (homepage)
2. Lookbook (visual showcase)
3. Product pages (individual items)
4. Checkout process
5. Legal/policy pages

Each page maintains the "craft over noise" philosophy while introducing commerce functionality.
