## üîÑ Copy Update Process & Best Practices

### **CRITICAL: Global Update Methodology**

**Root Cause of Homepage SZN2526 Issue:**
- Updated destination pages individually without cross-checking referring pages
- No systematic find/replace for universal changes (like season updates)
- Missed navigation links that reference updated content

**Prevention Protocol:**

#### 1. **Universal Changes First** *(Season updates, brand name changes)*
```bash
# ALWAYS start with global find/replace for universal changes
find . -name "*.html" -exec sed -i '' 's/SZN2526/SZN2026/g' {} +
find . -name "*.js" -exec sed -i '' 's/SZN2526/SZN2026/g' {} +
```

#### 2. **Site Architecture Update Order** *(Following Copy Deck Structure)*
1. Universal replacements (seasons, prices, brand terms)
2. **Homepage** (entry point - most critical)  
3. **Lookbook** (brand showcase)
4. **Shop/Catalogue** (product overview)
5. **Product pages** (individual updates)
6. **JavaScript systems** (cart, pricing, product IDs)
7. **Modal/interactive copy** (cart, forms)

#### 3. **Cross-Reference Validation**
- **Homepage navigation** ‚Üí All destination pages
- **Product pricing** ‚Üí Shop grid, product pages, cart system, JavaScript
- **Navigation links** ‚Üí Bag/cart references, back/view links
- **Dynamic content** ‚Üí Cart modal messaging, form states

#### 4. **Quality Control Checklist**
- [ ] Global find/replace completed for universal changes
- [ ] Homepage navigation reflects all destination page updates  
- [ ] All pricing matches across: shop grid, product pages, cart system, JavaScript
- [ ] Season references consistent across all pages and systems
- [ ] Cart functionality preserved during navigation changes
- [ ] End-to-end user journey tested (Homepage ‚Üí Lookbook ‚Üí Shop ‚Üí Product ‚Üí Cart)

### **Hardcoded Content Locations**

#### HTML Files (Direct content)
- `index.html` - Homepage navigation, brand messaging
- `pages/lookbook/index.html` - Collection name, product concepts
- `pages/shop/index.html` - Catalogue headers, intro copy
- `pages/product/*/index.html` - Product descriptions, cultural headers, ATELIER NOTES

#### JavaScript Files (Dynamic content)
- `shared/js/cart-manager.js` - Cart messaging, pricing, product names/prices
- `pages/product/*/index.html` - Inline JavaScript with pricing, product IDs

#### CSS Files (Label content)
- `shared/css/cart.css` - Form labels, button states (minimal)
